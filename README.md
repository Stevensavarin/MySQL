# MySQL
This was my first very complete database course with MySQL....
in which I obtained my certification, in the txt files I let you all the annotations about what I was doing during the course, 
it is necessary to emphasize that if you want to base on my annotations you must be careful since they do not have a concrete order,
since I have created them based on how it is more comfortable for me to understand and guide me, but even so I want to share them in case someone can use them as a guide.
and for me it was more comfortable to declare in MIN than in MAY in the TXT files.
